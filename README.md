Hello, my name is **Belinda Liang**. I graduated from Hunter College in May 2020 with a **B.A. in Media Studies** and a **minor in Computer Science**. I currently work at a non-profit afterschool program and provide guidance for high school students to help them achieve their goals. I am looking to combine my passion for **education and tech**  - **my goal is to design interactive experiences that are fun and engaging!**
